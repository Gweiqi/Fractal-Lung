\chapter*{Introduction}\label{cha:Introduction}
The model introduced here aims for
\begin{itemize}
  \item Simulation of MBW
  \item Simulation of DTG-SBW
  \item What is the basic model structure (governing equation, boudary conditions)
  \item Which quantities model variables.
  \item What are the main model parameters.
  \item How can the model (parameters) be modified.
  \item What is the model good for? What is possible with the model? Understanding functional realations, between structural and mechancical properties and variations/modifucations of these, and features of the gas washout profile. Qualitative replication of certain types of disease and conditions. Example modified lobular compliance.
  \item What is not (yet) possible? Replicating quantitatively all types of disease.
  \item Overview of the report.
\end{itemize}
