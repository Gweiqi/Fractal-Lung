Use the makefile in order to compile the code in a UNIX environment.
Simply open a terminal (in the directory containing the source :), and use the command 'make'. Then use 'make moveup' to move the compiled code to its natural habitat. Optionally, you can clean up the directory with 'make clean'.

On Windows OS it is recommended to use the Code:Blocks IDE and integrate the C++ source files in an dedicated project.

NOTE: Compiler for Mac => get Xcode
      Compiler for Linux => get GCC 4.8.5 or higher
      Using Code:Blocks you will have to set the compiler options via the toolbar of the IDE.
